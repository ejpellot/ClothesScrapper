# In this mini project I learned how to scrape data from 
# a clothing website using beaitufulsoup and store data using 
# a dictionary which then converted to a json object.
# Inside this json object there holds the jean key which
# holds different types of jeans and there info

# Then this data can be parsed for personal uses.
